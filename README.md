The results on the three building datasets can be downloaded via Baidu Disk：[Link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1MkoWfIyz7DADg37nUuMTgw?pwd=UANE) Code:UANE

We have released the codes of our UANet based on four backbones (*VGG, ResNet50, Res2Net-50, and PVT-v2-b2*). 

The whole training and testing framework of the paper have been released!

Our framwork has been deployed into application:

## Training Instructions

To train the UANet model, follow these steps:

1. Set the CUDA visible devices to specify the GPU for training. For example, to use GPU 0, run the following command:
   ```bash
   CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python Code/train.py -c config/whubuilding/UANet.py
2. Set the CUDA visible devices to specify the GPU for test. For example, to use GPU 0, run the following command:
   ```bash
   CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python Code/test.py -c config/whubuilding/UANet.py -o test_results/whubuilding/UANet/ --rgb

## Testing Instructions with Test Time Augmentation (TTA)

To perform testing with Test Time Augmentation (TTA), follow these steps:

1. Run the following command to perform testing with TTA:
   ```bash
   python Code/test.py -c config/whubuilding/UANet.py -o test_results/whubuilding/UANet/ -t lr --rgb

## Training Instructions for Multiple Training Sessions

If you want to continue training the model from a checkpoint or perform multiple training sessions, follow this:

1. Adjust the *pretrained_ckpt_path* in the config file.


## Reference
Our data processing  and whole framework are based on the [BuildFormer](https://github.com/WangLibo1995/BuildFormer). Here, we sincerely express our gratitude to the authors of that paper.
