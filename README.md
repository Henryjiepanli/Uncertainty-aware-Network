# Codes for 《 UANet: an Uncertainty-Aware Network for Building Extraction from Remote Sensing Images》

## About Paper
We are delighted to inform everyone that our paper has been successfully accepted by TGRS (IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing). 
[Paper Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10418227)

The results on the three building datasets can be downloaded via Baidu Disk：[Link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1MkoWfIyz7DADg37nUuMTgw?pwd=UANE) Code:UANE

We have released the codes of our network including four backbones (*VGG, ResNet50, Res2Net-50, PVT-v2-b2*). The whole training and testing framework of the paper will be released soon!

## Reference
Our data processing is based on the [BuildFormer](https://github.com/WangLibo1995/BuildFormer). Here, we sincerely express our gratitude to the authors of that paper.
