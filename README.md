# Codes for 《 UANet: an Uncertainty-Aware Network for Building Extraction from Remote Sensing Images》

## We are delighted to inform everyone that our paper has been successfully accepted by TGRS (IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing). 
Paper Link [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10418227]

The results on the three building datasets can be downloaded：Link[https://pan.baidu.com/s/1MkoWfIyz7DADg37nUuMTgw?pwd=UANE] Enter Code：UANE

We have released the codes of our network including four backbones (VGG, ResNet50, Res2Net-50, PVT-v2-b2). The whole training and testing framework of the paper will be released soon!
